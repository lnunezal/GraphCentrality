# GraphCentrality
Centrality analysis of a cell signaling network of a dermal fibroblast: 
1. Eigenvalue centrality: considering it as an undirected network.
2. Katz centrality, when considered a directed network. Two types of Katz centrality analysis: in-degree to analyze the most 
central nodes downstream and out-degree upstream.
